# Code Samples

This directory contains sanitized code samples from the Nandi Platform, demonstrating key implementation patterns and architecture.

## Structure

- **utils/** - Utility functions and helpers
- **services/** - Service layer patterns
- **infrastructure/** - Deployment configurations (sanitized)

## Sanitization

All code samples have been sanitized to remove:
- API keys and credentials
- Project IDs and bucket names
- Instance-specific data
- Production domain names
- Sensitive configuration values

Placeholder values are used where necessary to demonstrate patterns without exposing actual implementation details.

## Usage

These code samples are provided for educational and portfolio purposes. They demonstrate:
- Multi-tenant architecture patterns
- Content type system implementation
- Infrastructure as code patterns
- CI/CD configuration

**Note:** These are sanitized examples. The actual production codebase remains private.
