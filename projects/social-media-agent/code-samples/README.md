# Code Samples

This directory contains sanitized code samples from the Social Media Agent, demonstrating key implementation patterns and architecture.

## Structure

- **services/** - Service implementations (config, script generator, etc.)

## Sanitization

All code samples have been sanitized to remove:
- API keys and credentials
- Sensitive configuration values
- Project-specific paths
- Actual API endpoints

Placeholder values are used where necessary to demonstrate patterns without exposing actual implementation details.

## Usage

These code samples are provided for educational and portfolio purposes. They demonstrate:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation
- AI service integration patterns
- Configuration management
- Service-oriented architecture

**Note:** These are sanitized examples. The actual production codebase remains private.
