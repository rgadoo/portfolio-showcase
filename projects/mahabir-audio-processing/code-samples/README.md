# Code Samples

This directory contains sanitized code samples from Mahabir Audio Processing, demonstrating key implementation patterns and architecture.

## Structure

- **services/** - Service implementations (correction, transcription, OpenAI client)
- **database/** - Database patterns (manager pattern, models)
- **web/** - Web route patterns (sanitized)

## Sanitization

All code samples have been sanitized to remove:
- API keys and credentials
- Database connection strings
- Project-specific paths
- Sensitive configuration values
- Actual project IDs

Placeholder values are used where necessary to demonstrate patterns without exposing actual implementation details.

## Usage

These code samples are provided for educational and portfolio purposes. They demonstrate:
- Two-stage correction workflow
- Service-oriented architecture
- Database manager pattern
- Flask route organization
- OpenAI API integration
